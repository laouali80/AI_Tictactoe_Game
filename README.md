## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/AI_Tictactoe_Game.git
   cd AI_Tictactoe_Game
   ```

2. **Install Virtual Environment**:

   - For Windows:
     ```bash
     pip install virtualenv
     ```
   - For Linux/Mac:
     ```bash
     pip3 install virtualenv
     ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment**:

   - For Windows:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - For Linux/Mac:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:

   - For Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - For Linux/Mac:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. **Install Dependencies**:

   Install the required packages using the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Run the Game**:

   Start the game by running the following command:

   ```bash
   python runner.py
   ```

## How It Works

The game uses the **Minimax algorithm** to determine the AI's moves. The AI evaluates all possible moves and chooses the one that maximizes its chances of winning or forces a tie. The game supports:

1. **Player vs AI**: Play against the AI.

## Project Structure

- **`tictactoe.py`**: Contains the core game logic, including the Minimax algorithm, board state management, and win/draw detection.
- **`runner.py`**: The main script to run the game.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the dependencies required to run the project.
